# Overview

This code is for a Zoho CRM widget used in my Advanced Round Robin extension. 

I built it to improve the UX for creating round robin settings. Previously users had to enter JSON for field criteria
which was error prone and confusing. Now they can enter field criteria using a subform style interface.

The widget is built using React JS leveraging the AntD UI library.

# To Do

[] Set up auto save as soon as someone alters a row in field criteria
[] Allow users to delete a row in the field criteria subform
